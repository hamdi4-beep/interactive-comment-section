# Overview

This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor that I developed to practice my problem solving skills and learn of other alternatives that might yield better performance gains and reduce memory usage.

Initially, I used state to display and update the comments which helped me focus on figuring out a structure that striked a good balance between clarity and brievity.

Feel free to check out the deployed app and let me know what you think or what other features you might suggest.

I'm pretty much open to feedback as well, so I'd truly appreciate you looking through the repo to see how I approached this.
